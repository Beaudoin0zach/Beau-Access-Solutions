# BAS-Platform Cross-App Lessons

**What this is:** transferable mistakes and hard-won lessons that recur **across Beau Access
Solutions apps** but nowhere else — the shared `packages/ui` design system, the Keycloak login
theme + OIDC integration, the §4 accessibility spine, mobile-wrapper patterns, and cross-app
safety conventions. `@import`ed only by BAS app repos' `CLAUDE.md` (alongside the machine-wide
`~/.claude/shared/LESSONS.md`).

**Scope rule:** a lesson belongs here only if *another BAS app would make the same mistake* and
a non-BAS project would not. Truly universal lessons go in `~/.claude/shared/LESSONS.md`;
single-app facts go in that app's own `CLAUDE.md` or memory. Prune if this grows past ~1 screen.

**Governing doc:** [`docs/design-principles.md`](docs/design-principles.md) — the UX/a11y standard
these lessons defend. When a lesson hardens into a reusable primitive, graduate it into
`packages/ui` and cite it in §4 rather than leaving it as prose here.

## Accessibility spine & shared UI

- **One live region for all status announces failures as politely as successes — failures need
  their own assertive channel, warmed at injection.** page-repair routed labeling errors,
  extension errors, and clipboard failures through the same `aria-live="polite"` / `role="status"`
  region as the success summary; a polite failure queues behind the user's current utterance or is
  missed entirely if they've navigated on — exactly the SC 4.1.3 (Status Messages) case that must be
  assertive. → Keep a second `role="alert"` / `aria-live="assertive"` region and route only genuine
  failures to it (partial-progress like "labeled 40 of 60, run again" stays polite); **pre-create
  both regions before the first message** — a live region that enters the DOM in the same breath as
  its content mutates gets dropped by screen readers, so an alert region created only when the error
  fires may never speak. This is the §4 spine contract; every BAS app's dynamic-status surface has
  the same trap. (page-repair, 2026-07-13)

- **On a streaming / incrementally-updated region, announce once on completion — never per update —
  and remember an announcement is not focus management.** The Benefits Navigator assistant streams
  tokens into a response region; re-announcing that region on every token machine-guns a screen
  reader into uselessness, and firing an assertive *error* announce still leaves keyboard/AT focus
  stranded on the now-removed "Stop generating" button. → Keep the streaming region `aria-busy` and
  the live region silent while it fills, announce "Response complete" **once** on done (reserve the
  assertive channel for errors), and on *every* state transition move focus somewhere sensible — the
  finished answer on done, the recovery control on failure. Extends the §4 spine contract from
  static status to dynamic/streaming surfaces (any BAS AI or chat UI: KindredAccess, Benefits
  Navigator). (benefits-navigator, 2026-07-13)

- **Delegating status to one live-region utility means the visible status nodes must go
  AT-silent — otherwise every change announces twice.** KindredAccess added a single
  `ChatStatusAnnouncer` (two regions) but the visible typing/connection/presence nodes kept the
  `role="status"` / `aria-live` they had before; since `role="status"` *is itself* a polite live
  region, each change was read twice — once by the visible node, once by the utility. The design
  review caught the spec reproducing the very double-read it set out to kill. → When a status
  type is routed through the shared aria-live utility, strip `role="status"`/`aria-live` from the
  visible element (make it `aria-hidden="true"` or plain text) so exactly one path speaks. Same
  trap as a `role="log"` transcript that already voices incoming messages — don't also announce
  those through the utility. This is the §4 spine's implementation contract; every BAS
  dynamic-status surface (KindredAccess, Benefits Navigator, page-repair) has it. (kindredaccess, 2026-07-13)

- **A UI with no `color-scheme` declaration has only been verified in the theme you happened to
  view — dark mode is untested by default, and the browser may auto-darken it unpredictably.**
  page-repair's options page set no colors and no `<meta name="color-scheme">`, so its contrast held
  in light but was unverified in dark; a `kbd` border at `#999` was already sub-3:1 (SC 1.4.11) even
  in light. design-principles.md §4 requires contrast verified in **both** themes. → Declare
  `color-scheme: light dark` (meta + `:root`), drive colors from tokens with a
  `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` override, and verify every text (≥4.5:1) and UI-boundary
  (≥3:1) pair **numerically in both themes** with a luminance script — not by eyeballing one theme.
  Applies to any BAS surface with authored CSS (options pages, `packages/ui` components, the
  Keycloak theme). (page-repair, 2026-07-13)

## Identity, OIDC & mobile wrappers

- **Changing the shared IdP host silently strands every native wrapper — the web-side flip is
  invisible to them, and each wrapper tech hides the host in a different place.** Migrating the
  platform Keycloak to `id.beauaccesssolutions.com` was a one-line env change for the web apps, but
  three native surfaces still had the old host baked in and would have bounced in-app login out to
  Safari (or blocked it outright): Access Atlas's Capacitor `server.allowNavigation` listed the old
  IdP host; the KindredAccess wrapper had **no** `allowNavigation` at all *and* `WKAppBoundDomains`
  (Info.plist) locked to its own domain with `limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains: true`, which makes
  iOS refuse navigation outside that list; and CIT/Baseline bakes `EXPO_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` into
  `eas.json` at **build** time. None of this surfaces in web verification — a green `/oidc/…`
  redirect proves nothing about the wrappers. → Treat any issuer/IdP change as a **native release**,
  not a config flip: enumerate every wrapper in the same change (Capacitor `allowNavigation` +
  `WKAppBoundDomains`; Expo `eas.json` env), and keep the OLD host serving until the replacement
  builds actually ship. (bas-platform, 2026-07-17)

- **BAS realm client IDs are NOT uniformly suffixed — infer one and you'll wire an app to a client
  that doesn't exist.** The `bas` realm holds `cit-web`, `kindredaccess-web`, `benefits-navigator-web`,
  `disability-wiki-web` … but `access-atlas` (bare). Setting Disability Wiki's `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`
  to `disability-wiki` by analogy with `access-atlas` pointed it at a nonexistent client: the app
  looked fully configured and failed only at the moment of login. → Never infer a client id — verify
  it against the realm first. No admin creds needed: GET the authorize endpoint with the candidate
  id; a "Client not found" error page means wrong, the themed **"Sign in to bas"** page means right
  (an "Invalid parameter: redirect_uri" instead means the client exists but that redirect isn't
  registered). (bas-platform, 2026-07-17)
