# BAS-Platform Cross-App Lessons

**What this is:** transferable mistakes and hard-won lessons that recur **across Beau Access
Solutions apps** but nowhere else — the shared `packages/ui` design system, the Keycloak login
theme + OIDC integration, the §4 accessibility spine, mobile-wrapper patterns, and cross-app
safety conventions. `@import`ed only by BAS app repos' `CLAUDE.md` (alongside the machine-wide
`~/.claude/shared/LESSONS.md`).

**Scope rule:** a lesson belongs here only if *another BAS app would make the same mistake* and
a non-BAS project would not. Truly universal lessons go in `~/.claude/shared/LESSONS.md`;
single-app facts go in that app's own `CLAUDE.md` or memory. Prune if this grows past ~1 page
(**~85 lines**) — it is a narrower file than the machine-wide one (budget ~200), so it earns a
tighter ceiling.

**Governing doc:** [`docs/design-principles.md`](docs/design-principles.md) — the UX/a11y standard
these lessons defend. When a lesson hardens into a reusable primitive, graduate it into
`packages/ui` and cite it in §4 rather than leaving it as prose here.

Format per entry: **Lesson** — what broke → the fix. `(source-app, YYYY-MM-DD)`

## Accessibility spine & shared UI

The **normative contracts and their gates are C1–C4** in
[`docs/design-principles.md` §4.1](docs/design-principles.md) — read those for what to *do*. Kept
here is what that table can't hold: how each one actually broke, and where it is still unenforced.
Gates audited 2026-07-18 by reading the tests; **partials marked**. CIT was not checked out locally.

- **C1 — live-region spine.** page-repair routed labeling errors, extension errors and clipboard
  failures through the same polite `role="status"` region as the success summary, so a failure
  queued behind the user's current utterance or was missed entirely if they'd navigated on (SC
  4.1.3). *Enforced:* page-repair `test/unit.mjs` "live-region spine" drives the real content script
  and asserts both regions exist **before** any message, failures land assertive, partial progress
  stays polite — gated by CI. BN enforces it more completely still (pre-creation in
  `tests/test_assistant_template.py` + routing in `tests/js/assistant.a11y.test.mjs`); KindredAccess
  only the markup half — no routing test, so the bug C1 exists to catch is untested there.
  *Unenforced:* Access Atlas, Disability Wiki, native CIT. (page-repair, 2026-07-13)

- **C2 — streaming announce + focus.** BN's assistant re-announced its response region on every
  streamed token (machine-gunning the screen reader), and the assertive *error* announce left
  keyboard/AT focus stranded on the now-removed "Stop generating" button. *Enforced:* the inline
  template script was extracted to `static/js/assistant.js` so it could be tested —
  `tests/js/assistant.a11y.test.mjs` pumps 200 deltas, asserts via MutationObserver that the polite
  region never changes, and checks focus lands on the answer (done) / recovery control (error); CI as
  `npm run test:js`. ⚠️ `tests/e2e` is **excluded** from BN's pytest run, so a Playwright test there
  would have gated nothing. *Unenforced:* KindredAccess's chat surface. (benefits-navigator, 2026-07-13)

- **C3 — double-read.** KindredAccess added a single `ChatStatusAnnouncer` but left
  `role="status"`/`aria-live` on the visible typing/connection/presence nodes, so every change was
  read twice — the design review caught the spec reproducing the very double-read it set out to
  kill. Same trap for a `role="log"` transcript that already voices incoming messages.
  *Enforced:* KindredAccess `test_visible_status_nodes_are_at_silent`, shipped with the fix in
  `1b3506c` — but a regex over three named node ids, blind to a fourth indicator, nested regions, or
  `role="log"`. page-repair's is structural, but guards a surface whose announcer only writes into
  hidden regions — regression gate, not a fix. *Unenforced:* BN, CIT.
  (kindredaccess, 2026-07-13; page-repair gate, 2026-07-18)

- **C4 — color-scheme + contrast.** page-repair's options page declared no colors and no
  `color-scheme`, so contrast held in light but was unverified in dark; a `kbd` border at `#999` was
  already sub-3:1 even in light. *Enforced:* page-repair `test/contrast.mjs` recomputes every pair
  from the token hexes in both themes, **fail-closed** — a `:root` token in no verified pair fails
  the run (re-introducing `#999` reproduces 2.85:1 and fails). *Partial:* KindredAccess does real
  luminance math but two hardcoded 3:1 spot-checks only — no 4.5:1 pair, no `color-scheme` assert.
  *Unenforced:* `packages/ui`, Keycloak theme, BN (declares `color-scheme`, asserts nothing).

## Identity, OIDC & mobile wrappers

- **Changing the shared IdP host silently strands every native wrapper — the web-side flip is
  invisible to them, and each wrapper tech hides the host in a different place.** Migrating the
  platform Keycloak to `id.beauaccesssolutions.com` was a one-line env change for the web apps, but
  three native surfaces still had the old host baked in and would have bounced in-app login out to
  Safari (or blocked it outright): Access Atlas's Capacitor `server.allowNavigation` listed the old
  IdP host; the KindredAccess wrapper had **no** `allowNavigation` at all *and* `WKAppBoundDomains`
  (Info.plist) locked to its own domain with `limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains: true`, which makes
  iOS refuse navigation outside that list; and CIT/Baseline bakes `EXPO_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` into
  `eas.json` at **build** time. None of this surfaces in web verification — a green `/oidc/…`
  redirect proves nothing about the wrappers. → Treat any issuer/IdP change as a **native release**,
  not a config flip: enumerate every wrapper in the same change (Capacitor `allowNavigation` +
  `WKAppBoundDomains`; Expo `eas.json` env), and keep the OLD host serving until the replacement
  builds actually ship. (bas-platform, 2026-07-17)

- **BAS realm client IDs are NOT uniformly suffixed — infer one and you'll wire an app to a client
  that doesn't exist.** The `bas` realm holds `cit-web`, `kindredaccess-web`, `benefits-navigator-web`,
  `disability-wiki-web` … but `access-atlas` (bare). Setting Disability Wiki's `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`
  to `disability-wiki` by analogy with `access-atlas` pointed it at a nonexistent client: the app
  looked fully configured and failed only at the moment of login. → Never infer a client id — verify
  it against the realm first. No admin creds needed: GET the authorize endpoint with the candidate id
  and **read the HTTP status, not the page body**: `302` = client exists; `400` + "Invalid parameter:
  redirect_uri" = exists but that redirect isn't registered; `400` + "Client not found" = wrong id.
  ⚠️ Do **not** discriminate on seeing the themed "Sign in to bas" heading — Keycloak's *error* page
  carries the identical `<title>`, so grepping for it reports missing clients as present (that false
  positive was hit and corrected on 2026-07-18; an earlier draft of this very entry recommended it).
