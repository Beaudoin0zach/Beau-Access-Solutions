## Session: 2026-07-18

**Project:** bas-platform (DO App Platform secrets/DB hardening on benefits-navigator-staging)

### Failures

- **Wrong-platform assumption (Keycloak):** proposed "apply the bindable-DB pattern to the Keycloak
  app" and only discovered on inspection that Keycloak is Docker Compose on a droplet, not an App
  Platform app — bindable refs don't exist there → had to walk the recommendation back to the user.
  Lesson: confirm *where* a service runs before recommending a platform-specific pattern. **The
  answer was already written down** — `TRACKER.md` §5's hosting table names Keycloak "DigitalOcean
  (Droplet)". Read §5 before proposing any host-specific change; `doctl apps list` is the live
  cross-check, not the primary source.
- **`doctl apps update --format ActiveDeployment.Phase`:** `Error: unknown column` → the app *was*
  updated before the format error; re-queried deployment state with `doctl apps list-deployments`.
  Lesson: an output-format error can mask that the mutation already succeeded — check state, don't
  assume the whole command failed and retry it.
- **`doctl apps spec validate` on a live spec:** rejected with "secret env value must not be
  encrypted before app is created" because the spec contained `EV[...]` blobs → validated a scrubbed
  copy instead and applied the real spec via `update`. Now documented in the
  `do-app-platform-debug` skill.
- **zsh parameter substitution with escaped slashes:** `${URI/\/defaultdb/\/benefits_navigator}`
  produced a mangled URI (`invalid integer value "25060\"` for port) → dropped the backslashes
  (`${URI/defaultdb/benefits_navigator}`). Cost one debugging round-trip inspecting the URI.
- **BSD vs GNU tool assumptions (twice):** `cat -A` → "illegal option" (used `cat -vet`);
  `timeout 120 ...` → "command not found" on macOS. Lesson: this is a Mac — no `timeout`, and
  `cat`/`sed` are BSD variants.
- **Classifier blocks on infra commands (3×):** `doctl databases firewalls append`,
  and `git push origin main` were denied by the auto-mode permission classifier. The firewall one
  the user ran manually; the push is left pending. Recurring friction — worth a permission rule.
- **Connection-attribution probe returned nothing:** attempted to catch in-flight app DB
  connections by user via `pg_stat_activity` while curling the app; the pooled connections closed
  too fast to sample → verified the new DB user a better way (migrate job log + the fact that the
  binding is the app's only `DATABASE_URL` source).

## Session: 2026-07-18

**Project:** bas-platform (memory + skills audit)

### Failures

- **Reported transient eval artifacts as cruft to delete:** an `ls` of `~/.claude/commands/` showed
  11 hash-suffixed `do-app-platform-debug-skill-*.md` files; called them accidental re-saves and
  proposed deleting them → they were `skill-creator` description-optimization artifacts from a run
  minutes earlier and had already self-cleaned. Lesson: before proposing deletion of files you did
  not create, find what *writes* them (`~/.claude/skill-workspaces/` was the answer).
- **Declared a doc "nonexistent" after checking only the working tree:** `docs/deploy/benefits-navigator-oidc-integration.md`
  was absent from `main`, so I edited memory to say it doesn't exist → it exists as 93 lines in
  `b50c0d3` on the unmerged branch `claude/elegant-banach-721970`. Had to revert the memory edit.
  Lesson: "not in the working tree" ≠ "not in the repo" — check `git log --all` / branches before
  recording an absence as fact.
- **Miscounted worktrees in a delete proposal (highest-severity):** claimed 4 sat at `main`'s SHA
  with only 1 differing → actually 3 were no-ops and **2 held 6 unmerged commits** (BN OIDC scope
  doc, IdP-migration lessons, `bootstrap.sh`, `platform-status.sh`). A blanket "remove the stale
  worktrees" would have destroyed them. Lesson: never propose bulk worktree/branch removal from a
  `git worktree list` SHA glance — run `git log main..<branch>` per entry first.
- **False-positive Keycloak client probe:** discriminated client existence by grepping the page for
  the themed `Sign in to bas` title → Keycloak's *error* page carries the identical `<title>`, so a
  nonexistent client read as present. Fixed by using HTTP status (302 = exists, 400 + "Client not
  found" = absent). The bad heuristic was in memory and has been corrected there.
- **Asserted "marketplace-installed, reinstalling is one command"** about 4 Cloudflare skills →
  they were not plugin-managed and not in the marketplace cache, so deletion would have been
  one-way. Switched from delete to archive under `~/.claude/skills-archive/`.
- **zsh `nomatch` silently faked empty results (twice):** `grep -r --include=*.jsonl` and
  `md5 do-app*.md` aborted with "no matches found", which I nearly read as "0 usages" and
  "files already gone". Lesson: on zsh an unmatched glob kills the command *before* it runs —
  a zero count from a failed glob is not evidence.
- **`timeout 90 ...` → "command not found":** macOS has no GNU `timeout`. This exact lesson was
  already the last entry in this file from the prior session, and I hit it anyway.

## Session: 2026-07-18

**Project:** bas-platform (+ page-repair, disability-wiki, benefits-navigator)

### Failures

**Cross-cutting pattern worth naming:** four separate times a bug in *my own test
harness* presented as a product bug. Each cost a debugging detour into correct
product code. When a brand-new harness reports a failure, suspect the harness first.

- **`timeout 60 node --test` → exit 127 (THIRD occurrence).** macOS has no GNU
  `timeout`. Logged in the two prior sessions and hit again → prose in this file is
  not working as a control. Escalated to memory this session; see
  the "shell assumptions fail silently" entry in `~/.claude/shared/LESSONS.md`.
- **Promise-adoption deadlock (harness):** `startStream()` was `async` and returned
  the in-flight submit promise, so `await startStream(t)` *adopted* it — every BN
  test waited for the stream to finish before it could push the frame that finishes
  it. All 5 hung at 15s with no error. → Return the promise wrapped (`{ p }`).
- **Abort-ignoring SSE stub (harness):** the stub reader kept reading after
  `stop()`, so the client fell through to "stream closed without done" and reported
  a spurious error. Read as a product bug at first. → Honour `opts.signal` and throw
  `AbortError`, like real fetch.
- **Bare `fetch` hit the real network (harness):** the UMD module resolves `fetch`
  from Node's global, not the jsdom window, so early runs made real requests and
  surfaced as `stream_interrupted`. → Set `globalThis.fetch` to the stub.
- **`pretendToBeVisual: true` hung the run (harness):** starts a rAF loop that keeps
  the Node event loop alive; `node --test` never exited. → Drop it; nothing needed rAF.
- **Cross-realm array comparison:** `vm.runInContext('PRECACHE')` returns an array
  carrying the vm realm's prototype, so `assert.deepStrictEqual([], [])` FAILED
  across the boundary. → Copy into a host array (`[...]`) before asserting.
- **Reported CI green while jobs were still running (twice).** My poll filtered on
  `state=="PENDING"` but `gh` reports `IN_PROGRESS`, so the until-loop exited
  immediately. Told the user "all four green" before BN had finished — and it then
  failed. → Filter `IN_PROGRESS|PENDING|QUEUED`; never report a run from a loop that
  might not have waited.
- **Pushed a lint failure to CI:** `black --check` rejected my new test file. I had
  run the tests locally but not the repo lint. Compounding: BN's Lint step runs
  *before* my new jsdom step, so the gate I had just added never executed in CI. →
  Run the exact lint CI runs (`ruff check .` && `black --check .`) before pushing.
- **`set -- $spec` in zsh does not word-split** an unquoted variable, so a
  four-repo status loop ran with `$2` empty and errored four times. → Use a function
  with explicit args.
- **Two overreaching assertions, both caught by their own failure:** counted *all*
  inline `<script>` on the BN page (base.html legitimately has its own), and used
  `assistant-caret` as a "JS is inline" marker when it is a CSS class in the inline
  `<style>`. → Assert about the thing you actually changed, not the whole document.
- **Introduced a real bug mid-refactor:** extracting BN's inline script broke
  `{% static %}` because `{% load static %}` is not inherited from `base.html` — a
  `TemplateSyntaxError` on a page whose JS suite was fully green. Caught by the
  render tests I then added; those tests exist because of this.
- **Blocked action:** `gh pr merge --admin` denied by the permission classifier.
  Stopped and handed the command to the user rather than routing around it. Recorded
  in [[bas-infra-access]] so the round trip isn't repeated.

## Session: 2026-07-18

**Project:** bas-platform (BN OIDC client-secret rotation → DO SECRET conversion)

### Failures

- **Leaked a freshly-rotated secret into the transcript (highest severity, self-inflicted).**
  Piped the new client secret from `secrets.env` into an inline *heredoc* Python script; the
  heredoc body wasn't valid in that context, so the shell echoed the secret back inside a
  `SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal` message. The rotation meant to *end* an exposure
  created a new one → had to rotate a **second** time and re-verify. Lesson: never pipe a
  credential into an inline heredoc. Write the script to a file first, pass the secret on
  **stdin**, and assert on its *shape* (length/charset) — a parse error prints its input.
- **Told the user two vars were "still plaintext" after checking only the `type:` field.**
  `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL` read `type: general`, so I reported them unconverted — they had
  actually become **bindable references** (`${db.DATABASE_URL}`), which is *stronger* than
  SECRET and also reads as `general`. Had to correct myself unprompted. Lesson: for DO env vars
  read the **value**, not just the type; a `${...}` ref and a plaintext credential look
  identical by type alone.
- **Propagated the false-positive Keycloak probe into a user-facing claim.** Used
  `grep "<title>Sign in to bas</title>"` as proof Keycloak accepted the client/redirect — the
  *error* page carries the identical title (logged by a peer session the same day). The
  conclusion was right, but only because a **token-endpoint** test (`invalid_grant` vs
  `unauthorized_client`) independently proved it. Re-verified by HTTP status at wrap-up.
  Lesson: when a cheap signal and a definitive one are both available, report the definitive one.
- **Browser automation dead end:** `read_page` returned an empty tree and a coordinate click on
  the allauth "Continue" button silently did nothing (2 attempts) → abandoned the browser and
  drove the form with `curl` + a cookie jar, which was better evidence anyway (it proved the
  `sessionid` cookie persisted — the exact Redis write that had been failing).
- **Classifier blocks (3×):** an `ssh` command that grepped for credential *variable names*, and
  `doctl apps update --spec` twice. Same recurring friction the peer session logged — a
  permission rule is overdue.
- **zsh `echo ===` → `(eval):2: == not found`:** a bare `===` token is parsed, not echoed.

## Session: 2026-07-18

**Project:** bas-platform (TestFlight round: 3 rebuilds + BN/DW first builds)

### Failures
- **[investigation] Concluded "BN has no prod domain" from guessed DNS names → wrong; wrapper 1.0(1) shipped against the `ondigitalocean.app` URL where the Keycloak callback isn't registered (login dead-ends).** Probed `benefits.beauaccesssolutions.com`-style guesses and `doctl apps list` DefaultIngress, never read the app spec's `domains:` block — `vabenefitsnavigator.org` was PRIMARY all along. Caught same-day via a tracker row from the rotation session; superseded by 1.0(2) on the prod URL. Fix pattern: `doctl apps spec get | grep -A4 domains:` is the domain inventory, not DNS guessing.
- **[cap add ios] CocoaPods crashed (Unicode/ASCII-8BIT)** → `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`. Then **xcodebuild "requires Xcode"** (xcode-select → bare CLT) → per-process `DEVELOPER_DIR`. Both now in LESSONS + mobile doc.
- **[xcodebuild archive] Signed archive failed twice** — first "No Accounts" (no Xcode Apple ID session), then "team has no devices" (automatic signing wants a dev profile at archive). → unsigned archive + `-exportArchive -allowProvisioningUpdates` (distribution profiles need no devices).
- **[upload] Access Atlas "Redundant Binary Upload"** — ASC already held a 1.0(2) no doc knew about; local regenerated project said 1.0(1). → bump past ASC's number; ASC is the only source of truth.
- **[gh] `pr create` "must be a collaborator"** — active account was LangworthyWatch. → `gh auth switch -u Beaudoin0zach`, work, switch back (now in bas-infra-access memory).
- **[eas-cli] No `submission:list`/`submission:view` in any version; first Expo GraphQL guess (`submission` root field) invalid** → `submissions.byId` query with the `~/.expo/state.json` session token works for submission status.
- **[monitoring] Piped `xcodebuild … | tail` into the task output** swallowed failure diagnostics twice → redirect full output to a log file, grep the log.

## Session: 2026-07-18 (CIT numeric-PHI scrub-list fix, PR #41)

**Project:** chronic-illness-tracker (worktree `jovial-snyder-c3f316`)

### Failures
- **[Read] `src/lib/logger.ts` did not exist** — the handoff prompt cited `src/lib/logger.ts:36-76`; the real path is `src/lib/logger/index.ts`. Cheap to recover (the tool suggested the directory), but a reminder that a cited path in a handoff note is a claim, not a fact — the line numbers were right, the file wasn't.
- **[tsc] 40+ phantom type errors in a fresh worktree** (`Property 'status' does not exist on type '{}'`, waves of implicit-`any`) — read as "my change broke the build" for a moment. Cause: the worktree had no generated Prisma client (`node_modules/.prisma` absent; CIT generates to `src/generated/prisma`). → `npx prisma generate`, then 0 errors. **Diagnosis that saved it:** typechecking the *unmodified* sibling checkout showed 0 errors, isolating it to worktree state, not the diff. New worktrees of a codegen-dependent repo need their generate step before any typecheck result is meaningful.
- **[gh] Account flipped to `LangworthyWatch` twice in one session** — once before `pr create` (caught by `gh auth status`), and again silently before `platform-status.sh`, which then reported CIT `open PRs: 0` while #41 was open. The second one is worse than a failed command: it produced a **confident wrong answer** in the status board. → `gh auth switch --user Beaudoin0zach`; hazard now documented in TRACKER.md §1b. The script should distinguish "0 PRs" from "cannot see repo" and fail loudly.
- **[wrap-up] Phase 1 "auto-commit and push to main" was not safe to follow literally** — `~/.claude` held 76 uncommitted changes, 75 of them a prior session's in-flight skill reorg into `skills-archive/`; CIT's own work belongs on a review-gated PR branch, not `main`. → Committed nothing outside my own edits and surfaced the rest. A blanket auto-commit step needs a "only what this session touched" guard.

## Session: 2026-07-18 (cont. — merge + skill hardening)

**Project:** bas-platform (memory/skills audit, part 2)

### Failures

- **Wrote a worktree-cleanup procedure that was itself unsafe, then caught it by running it.** New
  `wrap-up` step 8 removed any worktree that was clean with zero unmerged commits. On the very next
  run all four qualified — but two had been recreated by live peer sessions at 09:11–09:12, minutes
  after I removed their predecessors at 09:00. A worktree in active use is indistinguishable from an
  abandoned one by those two checks alone. → Added a liveness check (directory mtime; and if a
  worktree reappears under a different random name on the same branch, stop removing entirely).
  Lesson: a cleanup rule needs a "someone is using this right now" test, not just "is it finished".
- **Near-miss: almost merged a lesson entry that taught a disproven heuristic.** The incoming
  `LESSONS.md` section from `claude/elegant-banach-721970` instructed verifying a Keycloak client by
  looking for the themed "Sign in to bas" page — the exact false positive disproved earlier the same
  day (the error page carries an identical `<title>`). A clean `git merge` would have committed it
  verbatim into the file that loads into every session. → Read incoming content on merge, don't just
  resolve textual conflicts; a conflict-free hunk can still be factually wrong.
- **Assumed the push was mine to make; a peer had already done it.** `c7d2b39` was pushed by another
  session between my commit and my push check. Harmless here, but the branch state you reasoned
  about seconds ago may already be stale in a multi-session repo.

## Session: 2026-07-18 (cont. — skill-eval harness debugging)

**Project:** bas-platform (description optimizer for `do-app-platform-debug`)

### Failures

- **Read a degenerate metric as a real result and iterated on it for 5 rounds.** The description
  optimizer reported `trigger_rate 0.00` on all 20 queries with the score frozen at exactly 50%; I
  treated it as "the description triggers poorly" and let it generate candidates. The candidates were
  never under test at all: the harness installs a hash-named *clone* of the skill, but the
  already-installed real skill shadowed it, so the model triggered the incumbent and detection —
  keyed on the clone's name — scored every correct trigger as a miss. → Quarantine the installed
  skill for the run. An all-zero or exactly-50% score is an instrument failure; reproduce one case
  end-to-end against the raw trace before believing any aggregate.
- **Then believed the *plausible* wrong number.** With shadowing fixed, results read
  `precision=100% recall=6%` — which looks like a genuine finding about an over-narrow description.
  It was a 30s/query timeout: generous solo (6.4s to first tool call) but a coin flip under 10
  parallel subprocesses. Caught only by noticing iteration wall-time implied ~28s/run. → Cross-check
  scores against wall-clock; the impossible number is easy to spot, the plausible one is not.
- **Told the user a branch was unmerged when it had already been merged.** Asserted that
  `claude/elegant-banach-721970` was stranded and its BN OIDC doc existed only there — both false at
  the time; a peer had merged it ~15 min earlier. I reasoned from a session-start snapshot instead of
  checking. → `git log origin/main..<branch>` before any claim about merge state.
  **Note the real gap:** `LESSONS.md` *already* carried an entry for this exact mistake ("the working
  tree is not the repo", citing this same 93-line doc), loaded in-session, and it did not fire. A
  lesson that isn't consulted at the moment of asserting is not a control.
- **Runner script failed on first launch** — `mv` into a `.quarantine` dir the script never created.
  Failed safe (skill untouched); added `mkdir -p`. → Scripts that relocate live assets should create
  their destination, and must fail before touching the source.
- **Background job killed mid-run when this session's worktree was recycled** by a peer. The restore
  trap fired correctly and the skill came back intact. → Long background jobs that mutate shared
  state need a trap, and verifying the restore is not optional.
- Minor: `timeout` is not present on macOS (GNU coreutils only).

## Session: 2026-07-18 (PM — TestFlight distribution + DW router + icons)

**Project:** bas-platform / disability-wiki / benefits-navigator

### Failures
- **[TestFlight] "Ready to Test" builds never reached the phone** — walked the user through 3 rounds of ASC screens (Users & Access ≠ tester enrollment ≠ build attachment) before getting an API key and *reading the actual state*: the two new app records had **no beta groups at all**, and AA build 3 was withheld on an unanswered compliance flag. → With `scripts/asc-api.py`: created groups, enrolled tester, PATCHed `usesNonExemptEncryption` on every build. Lesson shape: screen-walking is guessing; get API access and read state.
- **[scratchpad] Session reset wiped the scratchpad mid-flight** — killed a chained archive→upload task after the archive step (DW 1.0(2) sat unuploaded while logs claimed nothing), and destroyed the icon SVG masters. → Verified upload state via ASC API (not local logs), re-ran export; icons regenerated from context into `design/app-icons/` (git, not scratchpad, for session work products).
- **[xcodebuild] DW export failed "server with the specified hostname could not be found"** — transient DNS on Apple's upload endpoint → plain retry succeeded.
- **[icons] Two design mis-reads shipped to review** — KA split-seam heart read as a *broken* heart; stroked hands read as handset hooks. → Caught by rasterizing and *looking* before sending; fix was concept change, not tweaks.
- **[preview pane] Static-snapshot pages can't be screenshotted** (navigate → "No site is open") → `qlmanage -t` raster + Read the PNG instead.
